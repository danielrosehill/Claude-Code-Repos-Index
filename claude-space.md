# Claude Space

In my own words:

Many of the repositories in this index are what I have labelled (for want of a better word) a "Claude Space" - or a "Claude Workspace" (I use them interchangeable).

## What Is A "Claude Space"?

Repositories are usually associated with "code" - or development projects.

However they provide a very robust and adaptable mechanism for version control and for gathering resources in one space - and, through careful outlining, can support workflows. 

I use Claude for conventional development projects. But I'm more excited about their utility in managing organised AI environments.

Claude Code lends itself ideally to this pattern by aggregating all the constituent elements of agentic AI in one modularised area:

- A system prompt (CLAUDE.md) 
- Context (can be user-aggregated) 
- Output storage (the most neglected part of the AI workflow!) 
- Prompt versioning and storage 

Add slash commands, subagents, and the other bells and whistles that Anthopic is rolling into the platform and you have a powerful template for working on just about any major task with persistent memory and context!

## Claude Spaces For OS Management 

My first use for agentic CLIs (Gemini, Qwen et al) has been systems admin. Thanks  to their collective effort, running Linux no longer feels like a chore and my local network is well organised. 

I have experimented with two methods of using Claude as a helper of sorts for environments: whether those are local, on-the-LAN, or remote: Claude on each server or one Claude locally that knows your SSH commands. The latter is greatly enhanced by the use of SSH MCP.

At the time of writing, I'm not sure there's a meangingful difference in terms of performance - although there are meanginful differences from a security standpoint. 

What I *have* found useful, however, is defining repositories to manage systems - one repository per machine. These can be used to aggregate all the nitty gritty context data that makes or breaks the utility of agentic CLIs working on diverse environments: things like hardware listings, folder maps. These were the first "Claude Spaces" I created. 

## Claude Spaces For Other Projects 

Claude Spaces can also be used in any other instance in which you have a predefined bank of context data and want Claude to work in a deep research type capacity on one major project. 

I like to modularise tightly - which is why I also tend to create many repositories on Github! Each major project gets its own template and space. 

These follow a standard pattern for AI workspaces that I have been using for more than a year now. But each is adapted to the nuances and specificities of that project. 

Both type of spaces are indexed in the README.md.
