## Notes

### Beyond Code Generation: Claude for System Administration

A particular focus of my work with agentic IDEs including Claude Code is exploring their potential for **desktop administration and remote system administration** - essentially using them as **Conversational UI Agents (CUAs)** for infrastructure management. I find these tools transformative for system administration and other non-code-generation purposes.

### Claude Workspaces 

I've adopted a workflow concept I call **"Claude Workspaces"** or **"Claude Spaces"** (my own nomenclature). This is a repository pattern that defines a workspace for Claude to work on local or remote system administration rather than code generation:

- **CLAUDE.md** and **slash commands** can still be gathered there (as well as subagents and everything else that Claude Code provides), but the focus is on system administration tasks
- A common collection of folders can be standardized to provide modular areas for storing:
  - Memory files
  - Context files
  - Logs
  - Configuration snapshots
  - Documentation

Repositories following this pattern are marked with the ![Claude Workspace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude-Workspace-purple?style=flat-square) badge.
