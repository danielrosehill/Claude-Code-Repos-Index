# Claude Code Repository Index

My Claude Code related repositories, organized by use case and category.

Most patterns, templates, and models are adaptable to other agentic AI CLIs and frameworks.

## Understanding This Index

This index showcases diverse applications of Claude Code beyond traditional software development. Key concepts:

| Type | Description | Badge |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Claude Spaces** | Pre-configured workspaces using Claude as a Conversational UI Agent for structured workflows | ![Claude Space](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude-Space-purple?style=flat-square) |
| **Templates** | Forkable starting points you can customize for your own use | ![Template](https://img.shields.io/badge/Template-Ready-green?style=flat-square) |
| **Non-Code** | Applications beyond software development (research, productivity, health, etc.) | ![Non-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Non--Code-teal?style=flat-square) |

📖 **[What are Claude Spaces?](./claude-spaces.md)** — Detailed explanation of the Claude Spaces concept
📝 **[Notes on Templates & Workspaces](./notes.md)** — Additional context on these approaches

## Praise For This Repo

> *"This is either the work of a prolific genius, or a very clever bot (or both), although it hardly matters because the quality is so good - an index of 75+ Claude Code repositories published by the author - and I'm not talking about slop. CMS, system design, deep research, IoT, agentic workflows, server management, personal health... If you spot the lie, let me know, otherwise please check these out."*

For those wondering: I'm a real human ([danielrosehill.com](https://danielrosehill.com)). The repos and spaces in this index are generated using Claude Code but very much human-designed and refined.

## Commonalities

I've been using Claude Code daily for about six months, for everything from development to audio editing to SEO analysis. This is a diverse collection of repositories, but it tends to lean away from the classic code generation use cases. Instead, it explores the longer tail of what Claude Code can do — deep research, systems administration, legal workflows, health documentation, media monitoring, and more.

If there's a common thread, it's treating Claude Code less as a coding assistant and more as a general-purpose AI workspace that happens to run in a terminal.
