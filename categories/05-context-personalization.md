Comprehensive index and documentation of the "Claude Spaces" pattern—using Claude Code workspaces as repositories for non-development operational tasks. Features a curated catalog of implemented Claude Spaces across local and remote system administration, with detailed explanations of the pattern characteristics, implementation requirements, and potential applications across media processing, data analytics, content creation, DevOps, research, and monitoring domains. Includes guidance on adapting the pattern to other AI agent CLIs beyond Claude Code.
