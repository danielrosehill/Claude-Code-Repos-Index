Analyze the current organization of README.md using the index-organizer agent.

Identify:
- Miscategorized repositories
- Category issues (overstuffed, underpopulated, overlapping)
- Missing categories for emerging themes
- Alphabetical ordering problems
- Opportunities for improvement

Provide a comprehensive report with prioritized recommendations.

Do NOT implement changes - only analyze and recommend.
