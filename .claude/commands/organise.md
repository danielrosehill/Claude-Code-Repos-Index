README contains an index organising my repositories that are related to Claude Code.

Please parse the current list.

If you can identify ways in which the readme could be better organised, implement those changes. 

The organisational approach:

- Repositories reflecting a common theme are grouped
- A short description is provided explaining the cluster (immediately beneath the header). For example: "These repositories explore how Claude can work with MCPs."
- Then the repos are listed as H3, link badge, one line description, horizontal line

My overall approach to organising readmes, which you should adhere to: 

- Create enough sections that are useful for organising the repos into common clusters/groups 
- Create no more than that level of organisation!
