The user will provide a number of repositories in the index (or to be added) which are related: they explore a common application for the Claude Code workspace model. They should be grouped. 

The user will either ask you to suggest a category name and description or provide one. 

Upon receiving the desired workflow, please update the README to reflect the new categorisation.
