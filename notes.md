# Notes: Beyond Code Generation

## Templates & Workspaces

While Claude Code excels at software development, a significant portion of these repositories explore **template-driven workflows** for system administration, personal productivity, research, and domain-specific applications. These templates demonstrate that agentic IDEs are powerful frameworks for **any structured, iterative work** - not just coding.

### Understanding Templates

**Templates** in this context are fully-configured repository patterns you can fork and customize for your own use. Each template includes:

- **Pre-configured CLAUDE.md**: Context and instructions tailored to the domain
- **Slash command libraries**: Ready-to-use commands for common tasks
- **Specialized agents**: Domain-specific subagents for complex workflows
- **Directory structures**: Organized folders for inputs, outputs, context, and memory
- **Workflow documentation**: Guidance on using the template effectively

Templates are marked with the ![Template](https://img.shields.io/badge/Template-Ready-green?style=flat-square) badge and are designed to be **immediately usable** after forking.

### Claude Workspaces

A subset of templates I call **"Claude Workspaces"** (or **"Claude Spaces"**) focus specifically on **system administration and infrastructure management** - essentially using Claude Code as a **Conversational UI Agent (CUA)** for managing computers, networks, and services.

Workspace characteristics:
- **System-focused**: Designed for OS, network, or infrastructure management
- **Administration tasks**: Monitoring, configuration, diagnostics, security
- **Persistent state**: Organized storage for logs, configs, and documentation
- **Remote & local**: Can manage the local machine or remote systems via SSH

Repositories following this pattern are marked with the ![Claude Workspace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude-Workspace-purple?style=flat-square) badge.

**Why this matters**: These templates prove that Claude Code (and similar tools) transcend traditional software development. They're **general-purpose structured workflow engines** applicable to research, personal organization, financial planning, health tracking, and more. If your work involves iterative tasks, context management, and structured outputs, these templates demonstrate viable patterns.
